## 🚀 About Me
- 🎓 Applied Math student & lifelong learner
- 💻 Object-Oriented Programming enthusiast (Java & Python are my current playgrounds)
- 🎨 Secret crush on frontend development
- 🧠 Fan of solving Rubik’s cubes & playing chess (checkmate in 3? Let’s go!)
- 📊 Statistics wizardry with R—hypothesis testing is my idea of fun
- ✍️ Mathematical proofs are my jam. If you can’t prove it, does it even exist?

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Java, Python, R, JavaScript, HTML & CSS  
- **Paradigms:** Object-Oriented, Functional, Proofs by Contradiction 😏  
- **Tools:** VSCode, Git, LaTeX, Jupyter, Chess.com, and the occasional Rubik’s Cube timer

> My flagship repo: `motomatch` — matchmaking for motorcycles and math lovers alike 🏍️➕🧮

## 🧩 Fun Facts
- I solve Rubik’s cubes for fun and speed (PB: under a minute!)
- I sometimes dream in LaTeX
- Chess openings? I have a spreadsheet for that
- My favorite function is the Riemann zeta function (ζ(s), anyone?)
